# Accounting-Ledger-Application
A capstone project that tracks all financial transactions for business or personal use.

Started out with first drawing out the screens I would need(see picture below).

Once starting on the project I started setting up for the "Home Screen" first. I would set up all in the 
"ScreenPage.java". Once I finished getting all the screens working for the "homeScreen" I would setup another class
to space out the other screens I would need which was for the "Ledger" and the "Reports" screens. Since I already did the work for the home screen,
I copy and pasted the code from the "homeScreen" to setup "ledgerScreen" and "reportsScreen" More easily. Did have a issue with the user input being asked twice ,but was resolved by leaving it as "int choices = userinput.nextint()". Not sure if the best way to do it ,but works perfectly in the time of writing.
